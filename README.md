# Introduction to Statistical Learning with Python

In this project I will be working on the exercises, homeworks and projects proposed while following the ISLP book. 

**Motivation**

The main motivation of this project is to learn while doing and at the same time to get comfortable with using GitHub as a way to store files and upload projects to start displaying as a portfolio.
